\title{
Break detection in the seasonal and trend component of a univariate time series
}
\description{
Iterative break detection in seasonal and trend component of a time series. 
Seasonal breaks is a function that combines the iterative decomposition of 
time series into trend, seasonal and remainder components with significant 
break detection in the decomposed components of the time series.
}
\usage{
bfast(Yt, h = 0.15, season = c("dummy","harmonic","none"),  max.iter = NULL, breaks = NULL, hpc ="none")
}
\arguments{
  \item{Yt}{univariate time series to be analyzed. This should be an object of class "ts" with a frequency greater than one without NA's.
}
  \item{h}{minimal segment size between potentially detected breaks in the trend model given as fraction relative to the sample size
  (i.e. the minimal number of observations in each segment divided by the total length of the timeseries.
}
  \item{season}{the seasonal model used to fit the seasonal component and detect seasonal breaks (i.e. significant phenological change).
  There are three options: "dummy", "harmonic", or "none"
  where "dummy" is the model proposed in the first Remote Sensing of Environment paper
  and "harmonic" is the model used in the second Remote Sensing of Environment paper (See paper for more details) and
  where "none" indicates that no seasonal model will be fitted (i.e. St = 0 ). If there is no seasonal cycle (e.g. frequency of the time series is 1)
  "none" can be selected to avoid fitting a seasonal model.
}
  \item{max.iter}{maximum amount of iterations allowed for estimation of breakpoints in seasonal and trend component.
}
  \item{breaks}{integer specifying the maximal number of breaks to be calculated. By default the maximal number allowed by h is used.
}
  \item{hpc}{A character specifying the high performance computing support. Default is "none", can be set to "foreach". Install the "foreach" package for hpc support.
}

\details{To be completed.

# Simulated Data
plot(simts) # stl object containing simulated NDVI time series

# Real data
# The data should be a regular ts() object without NA's
# See Fig. 8 b in reference

# output
niter <- length(fit$output) # nr of iterations
