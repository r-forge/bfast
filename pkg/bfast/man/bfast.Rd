\title{
Break detection in the seasonal and trend component of a univariate time series
}
\description{
Iterative break detection in seasonal and trend component of a time series. 
Seasonal breaks is a function that combines the iterative decomposition of 
time series into trend, seasonal and remainder components with significant 
break detection in the decomposed components of the time series.
}
\usage{
bfast(Yt, h = 0.15, max.iter = NULL, breaks = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{Yt}{univariate time series to be analyzed. This should be an object of class "ts" with a frequency greater than one without NA's.
}
  \item{h}{minimal segment size either given as fraction relative to the sample size or as an integer giving the minimal number of observations in each segment.
}
  \item{max.iter}{maximum amount of iterations allowed for estimation of breakpoints in seasonal and trend component.
}
  \item{breaks}{integer specifying the maximal number of breaks to be calculated. By default the maximal number allowed by h is used.
}
}
\details{To be completed.
}
\value{
    An object of the class "bfast" is a list with the following elements:
    \item{Yt}{ equals the Yt used as input.}
    \item{output}{ is a list with the following elements (for each iteration):}
    
        \item{Tt}{ the fitted trend component }
        \item{St}{ the fitted seasonal component }
        \item{Nt}{ the remainder}
        \item{Vt}{ equals Yt - St for each iteration}
        \item{bp.Vt}{ output of the \code{\link[strucchange]{breakpoints}} function for the trend model (see Reference)}
        \item{ci.Vt}{ output of the  \code{\link[strucchange]{breakpoints}} confint function for the trend model (see Reference)}
        \item{Wt}{ equals Yt - Tt for each iteration}
        \item{bp.Vt}{ output of the \code{\link[strucchange]{breakpoints}} function for the seasonal model (see Reference)}
        \item{ci.Vt}{ output of the  \code{\link[strucchange]{breakpoints}} confint function for the seasonal model (see Reference)}
    
    \item{nobp}{ is a list with the following elements:}
        \item{nobp.Vt}{ logical, TRUE if there are breakpoints detected}
        \item{nobp.Wt}{ logical, TRUE if there are breakpoints detected}
        
    \item{magnitude}{ magnitude of the biggest change detected in the trend component}
    \item{Time}{ timing of the biggest change detected in the trend component}
