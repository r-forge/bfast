\begin{abstract}

Monitoring forest and land cover disturbances are critical for addressing impacts on carbon
storage, biodiversity, and other socio-ecological processes. Satellite remote
sensing enables cost-effective and accurate monitoring at frequent time steps
over large areas. Yet, methods to detect changes
in real-time within newly captured satellite images are lacking. 

We are proposing a generic approach to detect disturbances in real-time 
based on time series modelling of the stable historical period, representing expected normal behaviour. As such,
the differentiation between normal and abnormal change in real-time becomes
possible when new image data is captured. Validation and accuracy assessment of the real-time change detection method is done by 
(1)~simulating 16-day MODIS NDVI time series (2000--2010) with different amount of noise, seasonality and containing
disturbances at the end of the time series 
(2)~ using real MODIS satellite image time series. 

Results illustrate that abrupt changes at the end of time series are
successfully detected while being robust for strong seasonality and noise. 

The signal to noise ratio of the time series being analysed for real-time change remains the most important driver of accuracy and potential to detect changes.
As such, data pre-processing in order to improve the quality and reliability of remotely sensed time series remains essential to enable change detection in time series data. 

The method is publicly available within the BFAST package for R. This method is specifically developed so that it can be used a global scale since is fast, does not
depend on thresholds or change type definitions and does not require gap filling of time series (e.g. clouds). Furthermore,
the method is flexible and can be applied for different purposes (e.g. fire or oil spill detection) and onto all sorts of time series data (e.g. in-situ monitoring sensors or different types of satellite data such as the DMCii satellite image time series).

\textbf{Research Highlights}
\begin{itemize}
    \item real-time change detection within newly measured data using time series analysis
    \item a new method is proposed is freely available as a function in the BFAST package for open source R software

\section{Introduction}

% forest disturbances and their importance
% the importance of detecting disturbances in real-time? Disaster monitoring/ fast detection of current forest cover changes/ etc.

Real-time forest and land cover disturbance monitoring is critical for tracking human-induced and natural disturbances promptly. Such information is needed for signalling abnormal developments, quickly raising awareness, and allow for prompt actions to intervene, relief efforts and reduce negative impacts to natural resources, humans, and infrastructure. Real-time remote sensing approaches are already performed for weather monitoring and prediction \citep{Ebert:2007tj}, and in case of after-disasters and relief efforts \citep{Tralli:2005ch}. However, key to approaches looking at forest and land cover disturbances is that many change events occur worldwide at locations and magnitudes are unknown beforehand. In this sense, remote sensing tools can be in the first instance used to alert when things start to appear \emph{abnormal}. For example, deviations from \emph{normal} land surface phenology, defined as the seasonal variation in vegetated land surface from remote sensing \citep{White2009}, can indicate important changes forest health \citep{Stone2008,Morisette2009}, carbon status, and even climate change \citep{Cleland2007,Hargrove2009}.

% satellite data
Satellite sensors are well-suited to provide consistent and frequent
measurements over large areas which is appropriate for capturing the effects
of many processes that cause change, including natural (e.g., insect attacks, droughts, fires, floods) and
anthropogenic (e.g., deforestation, urbanisation, farming) disturbances
\citep{Jin2005}. % different change types in ecosystem dynamics
Many types of changes affecting the land surface and land cover operate in ecosystems and range from diurnal cycles to long-term change in vegetation patterns. The changes commonly observed with remote sensing approaches can be divided into three categories: (1)~\emph{seasonal or cyclic change}, driven by annual temperature and rainfall interactions impacting plant phenology resulting in distinct intra-annual patterns for different vegetation types; (2)~\emph{gradual trend change} such as trends in mean annual rainfall or gradual change in land management (e.g. forest regrowth after fire) that result in changes over several years or decades; and (3)~\emph{abrupt trend change}, caused by events from human activities (e.g. deforestation) or natural causes (e.g. wind throw) that change land cover over short time frames (days or weeks). %These different types of changes commonly operate in parallel and approaches to detect and map a particular change type have to include information about the other types to avoid confusion and wrong labelling of change. 

% problem statement
Estimating change from remotely sensed data is not straightforward, since time
series contain a combination of seasonal, gradual and abrupt ecosystem changes occurring in parallel,
in addition to noise that originates from the sensing environment (e.g., view
angle), remnant geometric errors, atmospheric scatter and cloud effects
\citep{deBeurs:2005jq, Beurs2005a, Roy2002, Wolfe1998}. The ability of any system to detect change depends on its capacity to
differentiate normal phenological cycle from abnormal change (e.g. drought stress, degradation, deforestation). An historical analysis using archived satellite data is needed to model normal, expected behaviour against which abnormal behaviour in the near-future can be described \citep{Hargrove2009}.

Several change detection methods are available to detect disturbances within
historical satellite image time series \citep{Kennedy2007,deBeurs:2005jq, Verbesselt2009a} but generic methods to detect changes in real-time within newly captured satellite images while using historical information are lacking. Two major challenges remain.
%Achim: why do you add extra letters behind each reference? it that done with a certain purpose?


First, change detection techniques need to be independent of region-specific thresholds or a change types while being robust against the inherent noise and seasonality captured within time series.
Most change detection methods require user designation of a threshold or change type definition separating real change from spectral changes caused by variability in illumination, seasonality, or atmospheric scattering \citep{Lu2004}.  \citet{White2006} presented a method for real-time monitoring of land surface phenology that avoids problems related to phenological metrics for individual pixels in real-time but requires a region-specific threshold for detecting change. The determination of thresholds adds significant cost to efforts expanding change detection across regions or when regions are changing.
Trajectory based change detection has been proposed to move towards a threshold independent change detection by characterising change by its temporal signature \citep{Hayes2007, Kennedy2007}. This approach requires the definition of the change trajectory specific for the type of change to be detected. Furthermore, the method will only function if the observed spectral trajectory matches one of the hypothesised trajectories. This illustrates that there is a critical need for methods that enable analysis of time series independent of region or data specific thresholds or change types to detect change in real-time.

% missing data: avoid smoothing and interpolation
Second, time series analysis is needed to differentiate normal from abnormal changes while being able to deal with missing data (e.g. cloud effects or sensor defects). 
Most existing change detection methods smooth or interpolate data using one of many existing techniques \citep{Jonsson2002, Roerink2000} when dealing with extremely noisy times series of remotely sensed data. For a given date, these methods typically require looking both backwards and forwards in time, negating use in real-time or forecast applications \citep{White2006}.  Also, time series smoothing and interpolation techniques model data and fill gaps based on assumptions of normal data variation which inhibits the detection of abnormal changes (i.e. disturbances, deforestation). Methods able to analyse non-gap filled time series are required to to enable real-time change detection.


We propose a generic real-time change detection of abrupt changes using time series data. The following major research questions are answered in this paper:

(1)~Can a period, representing \emph{normal} historical data variation representing both seasonal and gradual changes, be identified within a time series? \\
(2)~Is the model representing the \emph{normal} historical data variation able to reliably and fast detect abrupt changes within newly incoming observations (i.e. real-time)?

We assessed this approach for a large range of ecosystems by simulating Normalised
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series with varying amounts of seasonal
variation and noise, and by adding changes with different magnitudes towards the
end of a time series. We applied the approach on MODIS 16-day image composites
(hereafter called 16-day time series) to detect real-time forest
disturbances in a forested area in south eastern Australia. 

The approach can be used to detect and characterise changes within other
remotely sensed time series (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel sensors) or be integrated within monitoring
frameworks and used as an alarm system to provide information on when and where
significant disturbances occur. The method described in this study are available in the BFAST package for R \citep{R} from CRAN (\url{http://cran.r-project.org/package=bfast})

\newpage
\section{Real-time change detection}\label{sec:Method}

The methods proposed here are based on a similar additive season and trend
model as employed by \citet{Verbesselt:2010wo}. However, while
\citet{Verbesselt:2010wo} focussed on the question if and where structural breaks occur in the season and trend component of a given observed time series
$t = 1, \dots, n$, we want to investigate a different question:
\emph{Does the season-trend model for future observations $t = n, n + 1, \dots$ still
conform with the season-trend model established for the historical sample
$t = 1, \dots, n$}? Thus, we want to monitor potential abnormality at the end of a time series in
real-time by comparing it with historical observations.

\subsection{Season-trend model}

For the observations $y_t$ at time $t$, a season-trend model is assumed with linear
trend and harmonic season:
%
\begin{align} \label{lmod}
  y_t & = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 t + \sum_{j = 1}^k \gamma_{j} \sin \left(\frac{2\pi j t}{f} + \delta_{j} \right) ~+~ \varepsilon_t,
\end{align}
%
where the intercept $\alpha_1$, slope $\alpha_2$ (i.e. trend), amplitudes $\gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_k$,
and phases $\delta_1, \dots, \delta_k$ (i.e. season) are the unknown parameters,
$f$ is the known frequency (e.g., $f = 23$ annual observations for a 16-day time series),
and $\varepsilon_t$ is the unobservable error term at time $t$. The choice of
$k$ controls at which frequencies seasonal variations occur. In the applications
below, we employ three harmonic terms (i.e., $k = 3$) to robustly detect phenological
changes within MODIS NDVI time series, as components four and higher represent variations
that occur on a three-month cycle or less \citep{Geerken2009,Julien2010}. More information about this
season-trend model are provided by \citet{Verbesselt:2010wo}.

For inference it is typically more convenient to reparametrize the model
so that it can be written as standard a linear regression model while
still giving equivalent predictions \citep[see e.g.,][Chapter~3.3]{Cryer2008}:
%
\begin{align*}
  y_t   & = x_t^\top \beta ~+~ \varepsilon_t, \\
  x_t   & = \left\{1, t, \sin(2 \pi 1 t / f), \cos(2 \pi 1 t / f),
              \dots, \sin(2 \pi k t / f), \sin(2 \pi k t / f)\right\}^\top, \\
  \beta & = \left\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \gamma_1 \cos(\delta_1), \gamma_1 \sin(\delta_1),
              \dots, \gamma_k \cos(\delta_k), \gamma_k \sin(\delta_k)\right\}^\top,
\end{align*}
%
where the $p = 2 + 2 k$ parameters are collected in the regression coefficients $\beta$
which can be estimated and tested using ordinary least squares (OLS) techniques. In particular,
if all season-trend parameters in $\beta$ can be assumed to be stable for a given
sample $t = 1, \dots, n$, the OLS estimator $\hat \beta$ is consistent for the
unknown parameters.

\subsection{Monitoring structural change}

Based on the season-trend model introduced above, the question raised in
the introduction can be rephrased into a structural change framework:
\emph{Given that a stable season-trend model was estimated in an observed
time period, does it remain stable for future incoming
observations?} . An abnormal structural change is detected when the model does not remain stable for new incoming observations.

% If the model does not remain stable for real-time observations, it indicates an abnormal structural change in the process.

As the season-trend model can be formulated as an OLS regression,
we can leverage the methods proposed in the structural change literature
for linear regression models where this problem is known as \emph{monitoring}
of structural changes \citep{Chu1996}.

The idea for monitoring techniques is very simple. Given that the parameters
$\beta$ can be consistently estimated as $\hat \beta$ from a stable history
period $t = 1, \dots, n$, we want to check whether $\hat \beta$ still fits
the data $y_t$ for $t > n$. To do so, some measure of discrepancy is needed,
e.g., residuals, re-estimation of the parameters, or the score function of
the model \citep[see][]{Chu1996, Leisch2000, Zeileis2005a}. Here, we simply
use (suitably scaled) moving sums (MOSUMs) of the residuals in the monitoring
period $t = n + 1, \dots, N$:
%
\begin{align}
  m_t & = \frac{1}{\hat \sigma \sqrt{n}} \sum_{s = t - h + 1}^t (y_s - x_s^\top \hat \beta),
\end{align}
%
where $h$ is the bandwidth of the MOSUM and is typically chosen relative to
the size of the history sample, e.g., $h = n/4$ or $h = n$ \citep{Zeileis2005a, Zeileis:2010tt}.
If the model remains stable, the MOSUM process $m_t$ should be close to zero and
fluctuate only randomly. However, if a structural change occurs, $m_t$ will deviate
systematically from zero. A structural break is declared if the absolute value
$|m_t|$ exceeds some boundary that is asymptotically only crossed with 5\%
probability under structural stability. The technical details for the boundary are based
on a so called functional central limit theorem. See \cite{Leisch2000} and especially their Table~1 for more details.

In summary, when using the method on real data three steps are being performed: (1) verify which part of the history period is stable by going back in time from the last of the history period, (2) fit the seasonal-trend model on the stable history period and (3) monitor and verify whether the stable history model is still valid for the new incoming data (i.e. real-time change detection).

% JV: good section but maybe tool much details. However, Achim if you think this is specific for this paper I will include it in the paper.
% Here, we use the boundary function $c \sqrt{2 \log_+ t/n}$, where $\log_+ x$ is $1$ for $x \le e$ and $\log x$ otherwise and $c$ is the critical value that determines the significance level. The critical values also depends on the choice of $h$ and the monitoring horizon $N$, e.g., for $h = 0.25 n$ and $N = 10 n$, $c = 1.3409$ at the 5\% level.

\subsection{Selecting the stable history period}

A crucial assumption for the monitoring approach proposed above is that
the history period $t = 1, \dots, n$ itself is free of structural changes, i.e. that the parameters $\beta$ are stable during this time. 
Only in that case $\hat \beta$ is a consistent estimate (i.e. the season-trend structure
can be sensibly estimated) against which incoming new observations for $t > n$
can be compared.

In practice, there are often long series of observations $y_t$ available
before the start of the monitoring process and it would be naive to assume
that always all of these observations can be adequately captured by a single
season-trend model. Hence, a natural idea is to not use all observations
but only the last $\ell, \dots, n$ observations with $\ell \ge 1$ so that a stable
season-trend pattern can be established.

Ideally, there is prior subject-matter knowledge for a suitable size of the
history period. If not, various data-driven techniques for determining $\ell$
have been suggested in the literature. One popular approach is to assume
that there are multiple structural breaks already in the history period
whose timing can be estimated using the methods of \cite{Bai2003} (which
was is also a core ingredient of the BFAST method of \citet{Verbesselt:2010wo}.
Then, $\ell$ is selected as the first observation after the last estimated
breakpoint. This approach is straightforward and is known to work well if there are
large abrupt shifts in the season-trend model in the history period. However, \cite{Pesaran2002} show that, when smaller gradual changes occur, this
breakpoint approach is less accurate due to a trade-off between bias and variance.  % removed 'wastes power'

Hence, they suggest an alternative technique. By moving backward in time for $t = n, n-1, n-2, \dots$ they consider cumulative 1-step ahead prediction errors
until the season-trend model breaks down.
% OK solved. \fixme{when does this model breakdown? is there a threshold -> is this based on the central limit theorem similar as above with the MOSUM process?}
% Moving backward in time for $t = n, n-1, n-2, \dots$ they consider cumulative 1-step ahead prediction errors the season-trend model until this breaks down. 
The method is also known as Reversed-Ordered-Cumulative sum (CUSUM) of residuals, or ROC.
The ROC method is based on similar ideas as the monitoring approach introduced
above, but in reverse ordering. The season-trend model is estimated $\hat \beta^{(s+1:n)}$
based on observations $t = s + 1, \dots, n$ and it is checked whether the last
previous observation $s$ conforms with this. 

The suitably scaled residuals
$\tilde \varepsilon_s$ are then cumulated (in reverse ordering):
%
\begin{align*}
  r_i & = \frac{1}{\tilde \sigma \sqrt{n}} \sum_{s = n - i + 1}^n \tilde \varepsilon_s, \\
  \tilde \varepsilon_s & = \frac{y_s - x_s^\top \hat \beta^{(s+1:n)}}{
    \sqrt{1 + x_s^\top \left({X^{(s+1:n)}}^\top X^{(s+1:n)} \right)^{-1} x_s}}
\end{align*}
%

\fixme{Achim - is it necessary to mention the scaling of $\tilde \varepsilon_s$ with Xs, this scaling is difficult to understand}.

where $X^{(s+1:n)}$ is the regressor matrix based on observations $s+1, \dots, n$
and $\tilde \sigma$ is an estimate of the residual standard deviation.
For this ROC process $r_i$ with $i = p + 1, \dots, n$, there are again
boundaries (different from the boundaries above but similar in spirit)
whose asymptotic crossing probability under structural stability can be
controlled \citep[see][]{Zeileis2002}. 

If no boundary crossing occurs, there is no evidence for structural changes
within the history period. Thus $\ell = 1$ can be chosen and the monitoring
approach can be conducted as described above. However, if there is a boundary
crossing, the last observation before the boundary crossing is chosen
as $\ell$, corresponding to the last point up to which there is no sufficiently
large deviation from parameter stability. The remaining observations
$1, \dots, \ell - 1$ are pruned from the history period and then the
monitoring is conducted as described above but with a reduced sample
size of the history period (i.e. the stable history).


\section{Validation}\label{sec:Validation}

We validated the real-time change detection approach by (1)~simulating 16-day NDVI time series, and (2)~applying
the method to real 16-day MODIS satellite NDVI time series. 
Validation of multi-temporal change-detection methods is often not straightforward, since
independent reference sources for a broad range of potential changes must be
available during the change interval \citep{Kennedy2007}.
We simulated 16-day NDVI time series with different noise levels, seasonality, and disturbances in order to robustly test the real-time change detection capacity in a controlled environment. However, it is challenging to create simulated time series that approximate
remotely sensed time series, because these contain combined information on
vegetation phenology, inter-annual climate variability, disturbance events,
sensor conditions (e.g., viewing angle), and signal contamination (e.g., clouds)
\citep{Zhang2009}. Therefore, applying the method to remotely sensed data and
performing comparisons with in-situ data remains necessary. 

A similar validation strategy was proposed by \citet{Verbesselt2009a} to validate change detection capacity in the seasonal and trend component of time series using the BFAST method (\url{http://cran.r-project.org/package=bfast}), respectively. More details about the validation strategy can be found there. Here, we focus on the validation of detection of changes at the end of a time series (i.e. in real-time when new images are recently captured). In the next two sections, simulation of NDVI time series and application on real MODIS NDVI satellite image time series are described. 

\subsection{Simulation of NDVI time series}

%time series are simulate for the full period 2007 where we introduced an abrupt change in the year 2007. then the full time series (2006) is being used as the history period and investigated for stability and a model is being fitted. then we verify whether we can detect the change that has been introduced in 2007 while varying amplitude, noise, the magnitude of the abrupt change (dip), and the amount of data available in the monitoring period. 

% we focus on detecting abrupt changes in the monitoring period. so a time serieus with an abrupt change at the end of the time series is being simulated.
% amplitude, noise are being varied. in order to test the monitoring method the amount of data available for the method is being varied...

Simulated NDVI time series are generated by summing individually simulated seasonal, noise, and trend components. First, the seasonal component is created using an asymmetric Gaussian function for each season \citep{Verbesselt:2010wo}. No phenological changes were introduced here as the focus of this 
 
 
Time-series where simulated with similar parameters as show in Table 1 and

\subsection{Application on real NDVI time series}\label{sec:RealData}

% we use 16-day MODIS data to illustrate the concept and plan to use day and 8-day time series for operational forest disturbance monitoring.

\section{Discussion and further work}

While the data and methods used here are appropriate for proof-of-concept development, other applications (e.g. deforestation monitoring or oil spill detection) will mandate further calibration and validation and use-specific remote sensing platforms \citep{White2006}, as discussed below.

1. data set selection - daily? - cloud effect discussion - sentinel or the dmc constellation
2. phenological change detection is also possible. 
Continuous modelling of the seasonality using the proposed concept also allows for relateing remote sensing to a continual process of land surface phenology change instead of a single date extraction \citep{Verbesselt:2010wo,White2006}

Ideal prediction period discussion:
(1) how much data is needed before a break can be detected? 
(2) how much data can be used before the prediction of the model is not valid anymore?.  . See forecasting papers and also White et al. paper.

3. Pro's and con's of data simulation. Data simulation enables testing of a method however with data simulation it is very difficult to reproduce similar behavior as in real time series e.g. measured by satellite sensors of vegetation dynamcis.
Further work

4. no decompositioning is done here - one model is being used.

5. monitoring should be exported in an area where you now that the history period is more or less stable. e.g. if deforestation has happend in the year before the monitoring period than it should not be exported but been masked out from the analysis for example.

6. also keep in mind that positive and negative change are being detected so we should in a further fase verify in which coefficients (beta) of the most of the changes occur.

7. keep in mind that if there is a regrowth effect occurring and the ndvi is saturising we are detecting a change while in reality there is no real change.

The real-time monitoring could be further improved by including other explanatory variables in the monitoring model (e.g. temperature, rainfall) which will contribute to model the data and determine what is normal versus what is abnormal. Furthermore, the monitoring model proposed here can also further improved to be used as a forecasting model. Similar to current real-time monitoring approach, forecasting requires a profound understanding of vegetation dynamics and vegetation interaction with the atmosphere, combined with proper data analysis techniques  \citep{LeiJi:2004kx}.

%More info for other applications of this methodology:
%\url{http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/} 
% This might be an interesting link for real time change detection and application if we really want to detect changes fast
% if we really want to detect changes in real-time we should use the MODIS rapid response option
% this certainly needs to be mentioned in the discussion -- 


% for testing the method we will use 16-day MODIS time series for fit a normal seasonal change pattern (monitoring the stable period) and potentially use daily images to do the abrupt monitoring? or should we stick to the 16-day image at the end of the time series (easier!!! for programming purposes).

\readme{Deviations from “normal” land surface phenologi- cal development can be the first indications of important changes in forest health, including disturbance and recovery (de Beurs and Henebry 2005, Liang and Schwartz 2009, Morisette et al. 2009), carbon status, and even climatic shifts (Cleland et al. 2007).}

\readme{
Further, many methods assume that a given mathematical func- tion, such as piecewise logistic functions (Zhang et al., 2003), approximates true phenological development. In global, or even regional application this may be an untenable assumption, es- pecially in cases of disturbance, defoliation, or NDVI curves with sharp peaks or broad plateaus (Potter et al., 2003).}


\readme{adding co-variates e.g. like temperature, precipitation might help differentiating a real change from seasonality.}


\section{Conclusion}
Currently, real-time satellite images and their derivatives are routinely produced and published on the World wide Web (e.g. \url{http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/} or \url{http://www.dmcii.com/index.html}) but methods for real-time monitoring and change detection are lacking. 


This validation approach by combining tests with simulated and real data should be a standard practice when validating novel change detection approaches. Furthermore, methods being proposed should also be made available to other scientist enabling the reproducibility of the research and collaboration towards further improvement of the methods.


%The approach is adaptable to different remote sensing technologies and provides a foundation for ascribing a sequence of ground conditions (e.g. snowmelt, vegetative growth, pollen production, insect phenology) to remotely sensed land surface phenology observations \citep{White2006}.
